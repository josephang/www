                        I made this website as an officer for my high school club. I maintained both this website and 
						the club's Facebook and Twitter from the years 2013 until 2015. This was my first taste of Wordpress
						and helped me learn how to familiarize myself with the tool.

                        I made this website during my senior year in high school. It was requested that I try to make it based on the 
						Project Linus website, so wordpress was used again on a rented host server. This was made along side Chess Parent Resource 
						and was the first website I was paid to make.

                        This is the sister website to Chess Coach Resource. It was also made in Wordpress, but this time, I was using a rented
						host server. I edited some Wordpress plugins to fit the needs of my client. I became more familiar to the

                        I made this website about a year after graduating high school and after not writing a line of code for six months.
						It was the same client, and he provided me with the host server.

                        This is my pride and joy. Downloaded off of zurb and edited with nano over ssh in during a lecture,
						this website has taught me how to configure apache files, configure multiple hosts, and how to use CSS.
						I have broken and fixed this website so many times its not funny, it has also taught me a lot about my server
						and the backend.

                        It's not that I don't like Google Drive or Dropbox, I have a server, so naturally, I would use it to store files.
						Before I found Owncloud, I just had a bare index that held my files. I didn't write Owncloud, but I learned a lot

                        As my friend founded the club, I provided resources, such as my server. This is a Wordpress site
						because it allows for users not familiar with coding to make edits. I installed and host this on my own
